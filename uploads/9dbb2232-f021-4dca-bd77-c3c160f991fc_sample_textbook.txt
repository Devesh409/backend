        5. Artificial intelligence and machine learning
        
        Chapter 2: Programming Fundamentals
        Programming is the process of creating instructions for computers to execute.
        Variables are used to store data, and functions are used to organize code into reusable blocks.
        Control structures like loops and conditionals control the flow of program execution.
